description: In these recordings, we recorded neuronal activities from cortical-thalamocortical
  (CTC) pathway, especially the somatosensory cortex (S1), motor cortex (M1) and posteromedial
  complex (PoM) of the thalamus responded to different PRFs (pulse repetition frequencies)
  or DCs (duty cycles) of transcranial ultrasound focused stimulation (tFUS) using
  a phased ultrasound array to stimulate S1, M1 or PoM. These recordings also include
  neuronal activities recorded from the auditory cortex (AC) with tFUS targeting at
  S1. Recordings for each target are taken using 32-channel Neuronexus electrodes.
  Ultrasound stimulation is delivered every 2.5 seconds and each recording has 500
  trials. The spike time tiling coefficient (STTC) of neurons of different areas is
  included in this dataset.
